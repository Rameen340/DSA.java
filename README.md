Hello!
Myself RAMEEN SOOMRO roll number : ( 2k24/CSE/118)

this is my data structures and algorithms assignment 
the assignment consist of three programs 
I have done these tasks using java programming language 
in first one i have  write a program to reverse an array using stack data structure ..i give  the example output values in which the original array is {10,20,30,40,50} and afrer reversing it becomes {50,40,30,20,10}
secondly i have  write a program to match the parentheses stored in a string using stack data structure in this program i give the example input of parentheses {[( )]} then i set the if else condition to check either the parentheses are balanced or not 
thirdly and finally i have write a program to calculate the sum of all integer elements in an integer array by implimenting a recursive sum method/ function 
in this program i have create a integer string {5,10,15,20,25} and after applying the recursive sum method the output will be 75
